                        Hello! My name is Yahir Garc√≠a. 
                        I'm studying a bachelor's degree in Information Technologies at UAM Cuajimalpa since 2019.
                        2023 is my last year at college.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><i>"Never stop learing"</i></b> is a phrase that marked me a lot. I like to learn new 
                        things through courses and that is the way I've learning to code. Python is my favourite
                        programming language, however, JavaScript it isn't bad for me.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I had the oportunity to be a Database intern for three months where I learned a lot 
                        and was my first professional approach.
                        Also I did my social service in Mexico City Government.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>
                        I'm looking for a oportunity in Software Engineering where I could show my skills 
                        as iniciative, workteam, critical analysis, etc.
